# New Tab Page

It turns out that you can't configure the CMD+T (new tab) behavior in Chrome to open a specific URL. This extension is a workaround for that.

## Features

- Shows the current time
- Shows a beautiful background image from Unsplash
- Allows you to customize the background image by providing a URL to an image.

## Install

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
5. Enable "Developer mode"
6. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory
